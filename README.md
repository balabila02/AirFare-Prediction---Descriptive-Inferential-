# **AirFare-Prediction**---(Descriptive-Inferential)

Predicting Airfare for the routes in Europe continent considering various parameters such as Origin Country, Destination Country , Origin City , Destination City, Journey day, date difference between journey day from booking day, travel duration ,etc. in-order to enable the passengers to reserve their tickets at better fare Â  In the best interest of time and computational usage, we have considered only Euro as our Fare Currency in the Fare Currency column.
